TriggerEvent('3dme:toggleMasked', 'true')
```

# about 
This is a simple script that allows you to use /me what makes this different from other /me scripts
is that if you have a mask on it says "masked person" (easy to change language in server.lua Line *34*) and if you dont have a mask on it just shows your name.
